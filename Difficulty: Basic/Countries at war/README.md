The power of these soldiers is given by <strong>arr1[i] </strong>of<strong>&nbsp;A and arr2[i] </strong>of<strong> B</strong>. They can only attack their counterpart enemies like <strong>arr1[i]</strong> can attack only <strong>arr2[i]</strong> and not anyone else. Both countries have equal number of counterparts. A soldier with a higher power can kill the enemy soldier. If both soldiers have the same power, they both die. You need to find the winning country.<br>Note: If no one winning, then return "DRAW".</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Examples:</strong></span></p>
<pre><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Input:</strong> arr1[] = [2, 2], arr2[] = [5, 5]
<strong>Output:</strong> B
<strong>Explanation: </strong>Both countries have 2 soldiers. arr2[0] kills arr1[0], arr2[1] kills arr1[1]. A has 0 soldiers alive at the end. B has both soldiers alive at the end.Return "B" as a winner.
